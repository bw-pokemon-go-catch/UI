# Worthymon Landing Page

## Welcome!
This is the GitHub repo for Michael Perry's flavor of the Worthymon Landing Page. See it in action here: https://bw-pokemon-go-catch.github.io/UI

### What is "Worthymon"?
Worthymon is an app that was developed during Lambda School's July 2019 Build Week. Its ultimate purpose is to tell the user whether or not a Pokèmon is worth catching in the hit, mobile game, Pokèmon GO.

### How does Worthymon accomplish this?
Worthymon accomplishes this task by taking in data from the user (Pokèmon name, Combat Power, and number of Pokèballs in the user's inventory), combining it with data stored in a database, and using all of it in a mathematical algorithm.

### Where can I find the app?
You can visit my landing page (I hope you do, I worked hard on it!) where you can find links to the app, or you can simply find it here: https://worthymon.netlify.com/
